# Dynamic Analysis of Rail Bridge

- The **dynamic analysis of rail bridges** requires precise evaluation of structural accelerations under varying train loads and operating speeds. This application automates the generation of multiple time-history load cases within the analytical model, significantly reducing manual effort in load definition, data extraction, and result interpretation. It improves efficiency and ensures accurate, consistent assessment of the bridgeâ€™s dynamic response.

## Details

## version 1.0.0

### Features

- **Train Speeds**:  
  Define the initial and final train speeds, along with the speed increment, to automatically generate multiple time-history load cases.

- **Time Step Increment**:  
  Specify the time step interval for each time-history load case.

- **Bridge Type for Damping**:  
  Select the bridge type or input user-defined damping values. Default damping is applied per EN1991-2:2003, Clause 6.4.6.3 (2).

- **Train Load File**:  
  Upload an Excel file containing the train load data (serial number, axle load, axle distances). The plugin validates and displays the data in a preview window.

- **Rail Track Nodes**:  
  Assign the structural group containing nodes along the rail track where dynamic loads will be applied.

- **Acceleration Output Nodes**:  
  Select the structural group containing nodes where vertical acceleration responses will be evaluated.

- **Speed vs. Acceleration Plot**:  
  View the absolute maximum acceleration plot across different speeds and export the results in Excel format for reporting.

### Limitations

- The combined length of two consecutive bridge elements (x) must exceed the minimum distance between any two axles (d) of the train.  
- All input data must be provided as indicated in the plugin dialog box.
